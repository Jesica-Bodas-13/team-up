# TEAM UP
## Project Description: 
In this project, we are going to develop an all-in-one workspace management application that will be able to perform the following functions:
1. Invite users to the workspace to create tasks. Users can create a task and invite other users to the task. The users can also set deadlines for the tasks. Whenever a task is created or updated, all their team members would be notified via email. The team can thus work on these tasks and accomplish their target. Once the entire task is completed, the user who created the task gets notified via email.
2. There will be another feature for the users to upload documents of any format which can be accessed by the team members present within that task.
3. Finally, there would be a feature of a meeting schedule where the users can schedule a meeting. As soon as the meeting is scheduled, all members present in that task would be notified via email. 
Thus, all in all, we are creating a perfect workspace that would help the clients easily segregate their tasks and complete their targets before the deadline.

## Course Technologies:
### React
User interfaces and UI components are built using the frontend library React. It will be utilized to develop a single-page application and reusable UI elements for our pages.
### Firebase
A framework for creating safe authentication systems while enhancing the sign-in process is called Firebase authentication. We'll utilize Firebase to authenticate users for our app and support sign-in across several platforms.
### Redis
Redis is a highly efficient read-and-write in-memory NoSQL key/value store and caching technology. Redis will be used for data caching so that our application may make fewer API calls and respond to requests more quickly.

## Independent Technologies:
### Docker
Docker is utilized throughout the development lifecycle for quick, simple, and portable application development - desktop and cloud. It eliminates tedious, recurring configuration procedures. UIs, CLIs, APIs, and security are all included in Docker's full end-to-end platform, which is designed to cooperate throughout the whole application delivery lifecycle.
### AWS
Cloud computing services from Amazon Web Services are dependable, scalable, and reasonably priced. Free to join; just pay for services used.
